The next release's notes, gathered here until its `v<version>.md` is written: a `v*.md` file is itself the release.

## What changes

- **`mason share`'s password now reads `mason_share_` and 48 hex digits**, where it was 48 bare hex digits, so a secret
  scanner or a person reading a saved connection can tell it is Mason's. It is as strong as before, and it logs in only
  on the share it was printed for. Nothing to do on upgrade, unless a script of yours checks the old shape.
