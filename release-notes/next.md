The next release's notes, gathered here until its `v<version>.md` is written: a `v*.md` file is itself the release.

## What changes

- **The smallest and largest value of a text column, and a page sorted by one, are many times faster when your
  database sorts text by a language's rules** (a collation such as `en_US.UTF-8`). Metabase reads them when it scans
  a table, and for a table's preview. Over 4.5 million rows they took 3 to 22 seconds, and now take 0.2 to 3 seconds.
  The slowest case was a column where most rows hold the same value, such as a status. Over 30 million names they took
  2 to 4.5 minutes, close to the 5-minute limit, and now take 13 to 26 seconds. Names that begin with an accented
  letter, such as É, Ø or Ł, are as fast as the rest. The answers are the same as before. A list of distinct values,
  a smallest value per group and `FETCH FIRST … WITH TIES` are still slow.

## What was wrong and is now right

- **A table under `sync: replication` no longer blocks `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN` on your database.** On Postgres 15
  and later, the publication Mason makes for itself listed each table's columns. So your database refused to drop a
  listed column, with "publication … depends on column", and never sent a column added later. Mason's publication now
  names each table whole. Mason updates a publication it made before at its first start after the upgrade, once,
  while it keeps syncing. Columns a table's entry leaves out, with `exclude:` or `columns:`, now reach Mason over
  replication. Mason drops them as they arrive. They are never stored, logged or served. A publication you name with
  `publication:` is still never changed. If it lists a table's columns, Mason now says once that the list blocks
  `DROP COLUMN`, and how to name the table whole. This was listed as known in 0.20.0.
