The next release's notes, gathered here until its `v<version>.md` is written: a `v*.md` file is itself the release.

## What was wrong and is now right

- **A polled table no longer costs an extra connection to your database now and then.** On some machines, Mason's
  timer for the next poll woke a moment early. Mason then connected to your database, found no table due yet, and
  connected again a moment later to poll it. Now every timer waits until its time has come.
- **Mason no longer leaves a time limit on your database's pooled connections.** When the web page checked whether a
  table could be kept current by replication, Mason set a 10-second time limit on its connection and never took it off.
  Behind a pooler in transaction mode (PgBouncer, or Supabase's default pooler URL), that connection is handed on to
  your application next. Your application's queries could then be cancelled after 10 seconds, for up to an hour.
  `mason mcp` did the same on Mason's own Postgres API with each tool call's time limit. Now each limit ends with
  Mason's own query, whatever pooler sits in between.
- **Listing a JSON column's keys is now about as fast as on Postgres.** `jsonb_object_keys` and `json_object_keys` of a
  column took 16 to 70 times as long as on Postgres, grouped as Metabase sends it, with `DISTINCT`, or in a `LEFT JOIN
  LATERAL`. Over about 5 million rows they timed out. While one ran, a small query in another session waited up to 8
  seconds. Over 3 million rows they now take 3 to 5 seconds, a little less than Postgres, and other queries no longer
  wait. This holds for a synced table's column, and for a generated table's `json` column. A generated table's
  `jsonb` column gives the same answers as before, at the same speed.
- **A generated table's jsonb column now answers `->` and `@>` as Postgres does when its SQL wrote a key twice.** For
  example, `jsonb_build_object('a', 1, 'a', 2)` keeps the last `a` in Postgres. `->` read the first one, and `@>` checked
  against the first one.
