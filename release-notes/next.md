The next release's notes, gathered here until its `v<version>.md` is written: a `v*.md` file is itself the release.

## Before you upgrade

- **Each synced table with a `numeric` column of no precision is synced again once, at the first start.** Mason now
  keeps each such value's own decimals (below), which the data synced before does not hold. The table serves its old
  data until then, and a large table takes about as long as its first sync did.

## What changes

- **The smallest and largest value of a text column, and a page sorted by one, are many times faster when your
  database sorts text by a language's rules** (a collation such as `en_US.UTF-8`). Metabase reads them when it scans
  a table, and for a table's preview. Over 4.5 million rows they took 3 to 22 seconds, and now take 0.2 to 3 seconds.
  The slowest case was a column where most rows hold the same value, such as a status. Over 30 million names they took
  2 to 4.5 minutes, close to the 5-minute limit, and now take 13 to 26 seconds. Names that begin with an accented
  letter, such as É, Ø or Ł, are as fast as the rest. The answers are the same as before. A list of distinct values,
  a smallest value per group and `FETCH FIRST … WITH TIES` are still slow.

## What was wrong and is now right

- **A `numeric` column with no precision now prints each value as your database does.** Rails makes such a column from
  `t.decimal`. Mason printed every value with the most decimals any value in the column had, so `12.5` read `12.50` and
  `0` read `0.00`. Now a plain `SELECT`, `::text`, arithmetic, `sum`, `min`, `max`, windows, subqueries and the binary
  wire all give your database's text. A few readers still print the old way: `to_json` and its kin, `concat`,
  `format`, `||`, `array_agg`, a row's text, a scalar subquery, `percentile_disc`, `mode()`, `sum(DISTINCT …)`, a
  `UNION` without `ALL`, and a generated table's column. `docs/SQL-SUPPORT.md` lists them all, under
  `mixed-scale-numeric`. A fix for most of them is planned.
